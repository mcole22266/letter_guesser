# Purpose

A friend of mine informed me that his company was hiring and suggested that I attempt this programming 
challenge for the sake of practice. 

## Task:

Given a word guessing game (like that of Hangman), create a program to help optimize the user's guesses. 

**Note**: 
- Original Hangman game was not working properly so I rebuilt a similar game in Python located at 
`./lib/wordGuessingGame.py`. 
    - Uses `./lib/soManyWords.txt` as a word bank
- Solution is located at `./lib/guess_letter.py`
- Did not want to muck up the original directory structure so I've simply added my own solution 

## Solution to Programming Exercise

All necessary files are located at `letter_guesser/lib`

## Files
1. `guess_letter.py`
 - this is the actual solution using Python (Ruby planned for a later date)
2. `guess_letter.rb`
 - unsolved ruby solution planned for later
3. `somanywords.txt`
 - textfile filled with words that are randomly chosen for the hangman-style 
 game
4. `wordGuessingGame.py`
 - Had issues with the original guessing game so this is a mock-up Python 
 version that is functionally equivalent

## How-To
Simply open to separate shells - one for `wordGuessingGame.py` and another 
for `guess_letter.py`. Run both.

# Programming Exercise

Find the [wordGuessingGame](https://github.com/sparksmb/wordGuessingGame) repo, install and run the app to play the game.

Now complete the class `GuessLetter` (lib/guess_letter.rb) to help you optimize your guesses in the game.
