# Solution to Programming Exercise
All necessary files are located at `letter_guesser/lib`

## Files
1. `guess_letter.py`
 - this is the actual solution using Python (Ruby planned for a later date)
2. `guess_letter.rb`
 - unsolved ruby solution planned for later
3. `somanywords.txt`
 - textfile filled with words that are randomly chosen for the hangman-style 
 game
4. `wordGuessingGame.py`
 - Had issues with the original guessing game so this is a mock-up Python 
 version that is functionally equivalent

## How-To
Simply open to separate shells - one for `wordGuessingGame.py` and another 
for `guess_letter.py`. Run both.

# Programming Exercise

Find the [wordGuessingGame](https://github.com/sparksmb/wordGuessingGame) repo, install and run the app to play the game.

Now complete the class `GuessLetter` (lib/guess_letter.rb) to help you optimize your guesses in the game.
